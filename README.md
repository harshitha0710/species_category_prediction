# species_category_prediction
**Data Collection and Development of Machine Learning Pipelines in Cloud**

This project focuses on predicting the Category status of various species using Machine learning techniques . Where the to be predicted labels are: Least concerned , Endangered,Critically Endangered,Extinct,vulnerable , nearly threatened.Data includes factors such as habitat , no. of threats , category, and population trends, which are crucial for accurate predictions.
It identifies the likelihood of species becoming endangered. Data has been collected and analyzed from [https://www.iucnredlist.org/]() website.
By applying advanced algorithms to analyze patterns and relationships within the dataset , the goal is to provide insights that can guide conservation efforts.
