**Data Collection and Development of Machine Learning Pipelines in Cloud**

**üêæ Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting the conservation status of various species using machine learning techniques. The model classifies species into one of several IUCN categories: Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered, or Extinct.

**Key features used for prediction include:**

Habitat

Number of threats

Population trends

Existing category status

Data was collected from the website [https://www.iucnredlist.org/]() through automated web scraping. By analyzing patterns within this dataset using advanced algorithms, the goal is to provide actionable insights that support global conservation efforts.
